Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Locate the file model_plus_plus_allAug.gh5/variables/variables.zip.
Unzip the variables.zip file.
Move the extracted variables.data-00000-of-00001 file to the model_plus_plus_allAug.gh5/variables folder in the repository directory.


Running the Program IDE:
Open Your IDE:
Launch your preferred IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode, Spyder) where you have the project containing the main.py file.
Open Project:
Open the project in your IDE. This typically involves navigating to the project directory and opening it as a project or workspace in your IDE.
Set main.py as the Main File:
In most IDEs, you can set the main.py file as the main file to run. This ensures that when you execute the program, the code in main.py is executed.

View Output:
After running main.py, the IDE will execute the code and display any output or results in the output console, terminal, or designated output window in the IDE.

Important Note
Ensure that the variables.data-00000-of-00001 file is correctly placed in the model_plus_plus_allAug.gh5/variables folder before running the program. This file contains essential variables needed for the U-Net++ model to function correctly and produce accurate results.
